**Machine Learning Developer, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst**

[comment]: <> (I develop End-to-End Machine Learning solutions, perform statistical analysis and econometric modelling. I engage in every step of the Machine Learning lifecycle, e.g. business understanding, data wrangling, model training, deployment, etc. I am able to work without close supervision and collaborate with a team. I have a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics.)

I develop End-to-End Machine Learning solutions, perform statistical analysis and econometric modelling. I have worked on many projects in various domains such as healthcare, fintech, telco, IoT and more. I have engaged in every step of the Machine Learning Lifecycle from Business Understanding and Customer needs at the start to product Deployment or Visualization at the finish. As an Applied Mathematics graduate with a Master’s degree, I have a strong background in statistics, optimization, quantitative finance, econometrics and computer science.

Please look at my CV [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/resume.pdf) or github profile for examples of my work or contact me for more details on my experience.

## Summary of projects
Here is a brief summary of all projects I have worked on. The results vary from applications to presentations of results.
###### Effectivity of healthcare providers based on economic data
We calculated economic effectivity of healthcare using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). DEA models estimate effectivity frontier by optimizing input and output matrices for each subject in analysis. DEA was done using `numpy` and `scipy.optimize`, data manipulation with `pyspark`. 

##### Customer Relation Management data in TELCO
We looked for valuable insights from Customer Relation Management (CRM) data of a telecommunication company. Using `nltk` and NLP techniques (tokenization, lemmatization and word embeddings), we extracted features from a free-text commentary of customer interaction with company's employees. Using TSNE dimensionality reduction, we visualized customers in clusters.

#### Banking Process Mining
Each application for a bank product undergoes an approval process. We used `pyspark` to extract features for each stage of the process and trained LSTM neural network (`tensorflow`) to predict next steps of the process. 

### Predict the demand for mortgages
Mortgage applications create load on bank's backoffice - risk approval, real estate check, ... Predicting demand for mortgages or number of submitted applications several weeks ahead would help with backoffice resource management and planning.
