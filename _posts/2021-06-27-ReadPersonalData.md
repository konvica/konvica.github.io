title: Scanning documents for personal data
---

The business idea of identification of sensitive data needs no introduction. In my opinion it is one of the most popular usecases for Machine Learning. In this simple application, I leverage several libraries (`spacy`, `presidio`, `pymupdf`, `pytesseract`, `opencv`, `streamlit`) to process PDF or image documents and extract all personal and sensitive data like photos of a face or personal information. To set it up you need just anaconda or miniconda and to follow instructions in the repository [github.com/konvica/read-presonal-data](https://github.com/konvica/read-presonal-data).
